#  IaC  Assignment 2  #

 # Description # 
This segment of assignment briefly describes the content covered during few weeks of the module. Apart from descibing the objective it also describes about the methodology used to create the repositories in the existing GitHub account with the python exercises.


# Aim #
The objective of this assignment is :
1. To revisit the content covered in Git and GitHub.
2. To create repository "Python" in the GitHub account.
3. To save python exercises of week 2 -5 in the repository created.
4. To create a feature branch and merging it from remote to local machine.
5. To create a readme.md file, which explains the repo.


# Methodology #
This part of the file descibes about the methods followed to meet the objectives specified above:
1. Python repo is created by logging in the GitHiub account and selecting create new repo.
2. Certain other codes are used in the recommended way push the files in the repo.
3. All the exercises created during python walthroughs are pushed to the repo by remote origin 
4. A feature branch has been created which is later on merged in the repository.

# Conclusion #
This segment summarizes the document by closely examining the goals set and the results achieved by verifying and testing the gap between the two.

The detailed content and walkthroughs provided by the lecture gave the learner an insight into learning Python and GitHub. The detailed content on python enabled the learner to solve the exercises in python and with the help of detailed content and live lectures of GitHub the learner successfully created repository and pushed all the exercises to the repo by following the codes provided.
This was verified by the learner by logging in to GitHub and checking the repository created, which showed all the exercises pushed there.
Thereafter 2 feature branches were created 'Test' and 'red' , 'test' was created on local machine and was pushed to remote location, whereas 'red' was created in remote location and was pulled to local machine.
